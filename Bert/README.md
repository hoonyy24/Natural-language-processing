# My Understanding of Bert model Code

This repository contains my understanding of the DeBERTa model code, which is based on the original work by Microsoft.

The code is derived from the [DeBERTa GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoft/DeBERTa), and I have added comments to clarify how the different components work.
